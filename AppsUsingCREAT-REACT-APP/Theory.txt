Now we are creating app using NPM(NODE Package manager)
steps->

1.) Install npm--
2.) after install type in cmd (node -v ,then it give version of npm
v16.15.1)
3.)after that all are setup
4.)Open folder where you want to create react app, and then type

Semantic versioning--
2.3.5

2->Major Feature(Something that breaks API or command)
                (Includes version which breaks stuff. It can include removing APIs or changing names of functions so anything that works on v1.0.0 may not necessarily work on v2.0.0
)
3->Minor Feature(Something that does not breaks anything from older versions)
                (Includes additions of functions or API which does not break anything from the older versions So anything that runs on v1.1.0 should work on v1.9.0 as well.
)
5->Bug Fixes(Bug fixes,Does not add remove feature)
            (Includes bug fixes/documentation spelling mistakes etc.
)
